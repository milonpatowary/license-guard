# Support this project

`license-guard` is free, MIT-licensed, and maintained in spare time. There is no paid tier, no
"pro" version, and nothing behind a login.

If it saved you a licensing subscription — or the fortnight it takes to build one of these and get
the failure modes right — a one-off contribution is genuinely appreciated. It is never expected, and it buys no priority: bug reports,
questions and pull requests get the same attention from everyone.

## Crypto

> [!WARNING]
> **Send only the named asset on the named network.** These are per-network addresses. Anything
> sent on a different network — USDT over TRON to the BNB Smart Chain address, for example — is
> almost certainly unrecoverable.

| Asset | Network | Address |
|---|---|---|
| TRX | TRON | `TLVs5cx85cwUCCGV8KujZkh5gDCpxomTd6` |
| USDT **or** USDC | BNB Smart Chain (BEP-20) | `0x737d85ECF68EAEF3dA5Ac912412D98e721F80ab9` |

USDT and USDC share one address because they are both BEP-20 tokens on the same chain — the address
identifies the account, not the token. Sending either is fine.

The BNB Smart Chain address is an EVM-format address, which means it *looks* valid on Ethereum
mainnet, Polygon and every other EVM chain. It is not. Only BNB Smart Chain.

**Check the address before you send.** Compare it against the copy on
[the GitHub repository](https://github.com/milonpatowary/license-guard/blob/main/DONATE.md)
rather than a mirror, a fork, or a package-registry rendering — any of those can be stale or
altered. Verify the first and last six characters at minimum.

## A note on address tampering

Swapping a single character in a donation address via an innocuous-looking documentation pull
request is a known and recurring attack on open-source repositories. Two things guard against it here:

- `DONATE.md` is covered by [CODEOWNERS](./.github/CODEOWNERS), so a review is required before any
  change to it can merge.
- Any commit touching this file will say so plainly in its message. A change to an address that is
  not accompanied by an explicit note in the commit message should be treated as suspect and
  reported via [a security advisory](https://github.com/milonpatowary/license-guard/security/advisories/new).

If you maintain a fork, please point donation links at yourself or remove them — leaving them
pointing here while accepting the credit is the sort of thing that erodes trust in everyone's links.

## Other ways to help, which are worth more than money

- Report a bug with a reproduction. A reproducible bug report is worth several donations.
- Tell me what broke in production. Failure reports from real systems are how the awkward cases in
  the README got written.
- Improve the docs. If something took you two attempts to understand, that is a docs bug.
- Star the repo, or mention it where someone is about to pay per-install for this.

protection, deployment telemetry — I take on retained development and platform ownership contracts

Thank you either way. — Milon
